have you ever created a gorgeous app that works like wonders on your phone <br>
and then someone using system UI navigationbar says "the content hides behind the navigation bar"?!<br>
well it happened to me, so i created this to know how much space the navigation bar takes (if any) <br>

final _betterNavbarResponsivePlugin = BetterNavbarResponsive();
